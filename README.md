# Hilo
Are you a good guesser? Hilo is a simple game in which a card is presented,
and you must guess if the next one will be higher or lower. A correct guess
gains you 100 points and incorrect loses you 75. You will start with 300.
If you reach 0 points the game is over. Good luck!

## Getting Started
---
Have Python 3.10 or newer. Navigate to the project root folder in a terminal
and run on of the following commands depending on your system:

	python3 hilo
	py hilo

You can also run the program by opening the game folder inside the root and
running __main__.py with an IDE like Visual Studio Code.

## Project Structure
---
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- dice                (source code for game)
  +-- game              (specific classes)
  +-- __main__.py       (program entry point)
+-- README.md           (general info)
```
